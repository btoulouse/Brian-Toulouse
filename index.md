## Professional Self-Assessment

This ePortfolio has helped me highlight the skills I have gained through the Computer Science Program at Southern New Hampshire University. To have the opportunity to go through my past projects and select the ones that highlight and enhance the skills of my choice will help me launch my career. Using GitHub to house my selected projects in a portfolio has also given me more experience and knowledge working in a collaborative environment, which can easily translate to working in a similar environments with future teammates. Additionally, including narratives with each project has helped me practice explaining in non-technical terms – another invaluable skill to have as a future back-end developer. When choosing my projects, I was able to select projects that fully highlighted my skills in data structures, algorithms, databases, software design and engineering. While revisiting these projects, I also found ways to enhance my programs and most importantly make them more secure.   

I’ve chosen three separate projects to include in my portfolio. To highlight my abilities in software design and engineering, I selected my mobile app. This project helps to demonstrate my software design abilities – from creating the concept of the design to finalizing it by creating a wireframe. To showcase my skills with data structures and algorithms, I created a program that has three different data structures, each with multiple different algorithms to load and sort information from a spreadsheet. Along with creating my own MySQL database, I also created an SQLite database to store user information in my mobile app. These two programs show my abilities to not only create but interact with different types of databases.     

### Software Design and Engineering:

[Portfolio Mobile App](https://github.com/btoulouse/mobileEPortfolio.git)

This artifact was created in the class Mobile Architecture & Programing during the 20EW4 term. It is an app that works as a portfolio. The app creates a user profile that has user and login information stored in a SQlite database. It opens a few websites the user enters in their profile. It also uses the Google Maps API and connects to the user’s LinkedIn profile. It gives the user the ability to write and load text files, intended to be used as a bio for the user. Lastly, it allows the user to enter events into the calendar already on their phone. 

I included this item because it showcases a variety of skills. From design, to implementation, to refinement, I created everything from scratch. Starting with the creation of the database to creating the program to interact with it. This database can create, search, and delete an entry. It also displays a security mindset as it checks all user input and user credentials before it lets the user access the app. It also shows my ability to work with different API’s. I made several improvements to this app – ranging from general functionality and flow improvements to major security issues. While making the enhancements, I found a bug where once logged in, the user could edit other database entries if the user knew the name entered. This was corrected so that the user can only edit their own information. 

I met all the planned improvements for this project, and I also made some enhancements to additional aspects of the project that I found while testing the program, as mentioned above. There is one more planned enhancement I have left to do on this project. I found a bug in the program where if a user attempts to log in with a deleted profile, the project crashes. I suspect this is caused from the deleteUser() function from the file PDHandler.jave file not functioning properly. I have a temporary fix in place where if that event happens it starts a new activity. Essentially just reloading the same page. While this may not be ideal, it keeps the program from crashing. 

I really enjoyed revisiting this project. This project was originally given to me about halfway through my degree program. To come back to it now has really helped me to realize how much I have improved as a developer. One thing I learned while making improvements was to keep the design simple. It started off too complicated and now that I have simplified it, it has improved greatly. My biggest challenge also came from changing the design. The base code was mainly all already there. However, moving different functions to different pages, things got a lot more complicated than I was anticipating. I overcame this by getting organized. I made a flowchart in a note pad and used that as my reference point. This project really helped me to practice and improve my ability to design and plan out a project. 

### Algorithm and Data Structures:

[Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/btoulouse/DataBaseandAlg)

This artifact was made up of different lessons, labs, and assignments from my Algorithms and Data Structures class. I took several different assignments and combined them into a bigger project. The program loads information from a .csv file into different data structures, which the user can then pick from. The user can choose between a vector, a binary tree, or a hash table. Then, depending on the data structure they selected, there are different actions they can take. Such as sorting in different ways, searching for a specific item, etc. In addition, all these actions have a timer included that tracks how long each action takes, so that the user can compare the different data structures and different algorithms against one another. 

My goal is to become a back-end developer. A huge part of that is dealing with data structures and algorithms. That is why I chose this artifact to show my skills in this area. This entire program is made up of data structures and different algorithms that work with them to complete different goals and track their efficiency. This artifact was improved by putting these different components together. It is made up from several different assignments and put together so they can be easily compared for efficiency. 

I did meet all the goals I set out to when I originally selected the enhancement. Now that I have made the enhancements, there is one additional piece that I want to improve upon even further. As it stands, the entire program is on one file. I would like to find a way to break these up into different files for each data structure and then have the main function in its own file. I believe this would greatly improve the organization of project and help the overall readability. 

The main issue I faced while working on this enhancement was not having access to the resource files. There was an issue of me unexpectedly losing access to the virtual desktop. I had all the cpp files I needed, but without the resource files I was not able to load any of the information into the data structures or test the program at all. I created the program as best as I could without being able to run it or do any testing. This really made me focus on what I was doing and why I was doing it. Then, I went through the program testing it on paper, without really being able to run it. This was a tremendous learning opportunity, as it forced me to work and look at the program in a new way. I was able to catch and fix a quite a few bugs so by the time I received the resource files I needed, everything worked smoothly. 

### Database:

[MySQL Database](https://github.com/btoulouse/MessagingDB)

This messaging database artifact was originally created in the class DAD-220: Intro to SQL. The database was created in the codio environment. The database includes a few different tables some of which are joined to share information. Including a person table, a contact table, a message table, and an image table. This was originally created in term 19EW3. I took this database and recreated it onto my local machine.

I selected this artifact because it also displays a variety of skills. It shows a command of essential SQL subsets, such as DDL (Data Definition Language), which are commands like create, alter, and delete. It also shows my ability to use the DML (Data Manipulation Language) subset. This uses commands such as insert, update, delete and retrieve data from the database. And finally, it displays skills in DCL (Data Control Language) involving granting and removing user permissions. 

I did meet all the objectives I planned to meet with this enhancement. I was able to fully recreate the databased. Curretnly, I do not have any further updates to my outcome coverage plan. 

I really enjoyed working on this artifact. It was nice to go back and work with MySQL again, and it reinforced what I learned in that course. The main thing I learned working on this program was installing and working with the MYSQL Workbench. Through most of my time at SNHU, I have worked on a remote desktop or through some online environment. I have learned a lot by having to go back to these older projects and learning how to install and work the environments on my local machine.
